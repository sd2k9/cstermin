Program
*******

Misc:
- keep order of Lines in the ConfigFile while writeback
- allow configuration of date format in display and config file

Gtk2-Widget:
- think about how to let Gtk2 parse its standard arguments from the
  command line without loading the whole Gtk2 always (even when
  we don't want to use it)

config file:
- disable UTF8 for config file (and terminal output) on the command line
- allow comments after lines
- when invalid entry encountered, print line number
