Overview
********

cstermin is a small scheduler for keeping track of recurring
events like birthdays or one-time appointments.
The appointments are read from an configuration file created
by the user and displayed on the console or with the help of
a Gtk widget.

You can configure how long in advance you want to be informed,
whether the entry should be deleted after passing, you want to
be messaged every startup or only once a day and other things.

It is intended to be put into the autostart mechanism of your
window manager when you usually start your machine at least
once a day. Otherwise a cron job should do the job.

The idea of cstermin and the structure of the configuration file
is based on the program CrossSecretary
(http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~akb/busse/cs.htm,
German), which is an multifunctional mail filter for the
once famous CrossPoint mail program. In the case
of CrossSecretary, the active appointments were displayed in
form of a pseudo-mail inside CrossPoint.
cstermin lacks the mailing ability, but instead offers
a nice graphical window. :-)

To sum up, cstermin follows the philosophy of "a small tool
to solve one task" and tries to provide a simple tool for
keeping track of all the birthdays and things you want to
remember for next month (and always end up forgetting).

Requirements
************

First of all perl itself is needed, but also some packages
from CPAN.
The CPAN-Modules can be found at http://search.cpan.org
or probably in your distribution's package manager.

- perl 5, tested with version 5.8.2, 5.8.8, 5.32.1
- CPAN Time::ParseDate from Time-modules, tested with version 2015.103
  - Package libtime-parsedate-perl on Debian/Ubuntu

If you want a nice graphical window for displaying, you also need
the following:
CPAN Gtk3 (package libgtk3-perl on Debian/Ubuntu), tested with version 0.038

cstermin is likely to work also with other versions than the
one mentioned here. When you encounter problems just
drop me a note.



Installation
************

Just copy (or link) the executable cstermin.pl into your path or
any place you like. If you want to see the program icon also move
cstermin.png into the same directory.

Finally create a configuration file at $HOME/.csterminrc and you're done.
You can use the supplied file cstermin.conf.template as a reference.


Function
********

The operation of cstermin is quite simple.
Upon startup it first reads the configuration file which includes
the appointments and further settings.
If not overridden on the command line the default config file
is "~/.csterminrc".

The settings from the configuration file can also be overridden
by the command line.

If not told differently, first of all cstermin checks whether
it was started already today and exits if it is the case.

Then the appointments are parsed and depending on the given lead time
they are selected or hold back. For displayed items cstermin knows three
different types:
- Today  - the appointment is defined for today (marked TODAY)
- Passed - the appointment date passed already, but cstermin was not
           called at this day    (marked by PASSED and date of occurrence)
- Normal - all other appointments (marked by date of occurrence)

Depending on the output chosen, the selected appointments will be
printed on the screen and/or displayed in a graphical window.
To match the character encoding of the configuration file and
the Gtk window the console output is also done in UTF-8.


Configuration File
******************

This is the main point of interaction with cstermin.
The expected character coding is UTF-8.

Every line forms a single data unit whereby three types are
distinguished.

Ignore
------

Empty lines and lines starting with an hash (#) character are ignored
in the processing.

Appointment
-----------

The main type of data. This is what cstermin is all about.
They look the following way:
10.05.2004|visit Tom|J|5
22.10.****|Birthday Lisa, age [1990]|N|10
15.01.2006|go to world cup in Germany|N|3

The structure is explained in the following section
"Appointment Definition".

Settings
--------

Settings look like this and change the behavior of cstermin.
Options: Debug
Options: Output-Console yes

See section "Configuration" for all possibilities to set and unset them.


*Attention!*
For storing its calling time, cstermin modifies the config file by
itself (unless told otherwise). In the write-back process all Options
are moved to the beginning of the file, sorted by name.
Therefore it is advisable that you refrain from adding comments about
options, as they will be separated from their associated Option anyway.



Appointment Definition
**********************

10.05.2004|visit Tom|J|5
22.10.****|Birthday Lisa, age [1990]|N|10
15.01.2006|Go to world cup in Germany|J|3
15.**.****|Do something nice each month|N|3

Every entry consists of 4 fields, separated by a vertical slash.
The meaning is:
date|text|delete|lead

date - Date of the appointment
    This field is further subdivided into day, month and year,
    separated by dots. The format is DD.MM.YYYY.
    A special form replaces the year with asterisks (*, **, *** or
    **** are valid), which means an annual appointment.
    Replacing the month with asterisks (* or  **),
    specifies a monthly appointment.

text - Description of the appointment
     This text will be displayed.
     You can embed a tag of the form "[yyyy]", which will be replaced
     by the year difference to now. Very handy when you cannot remember
     neither birthday nor age of the person in question.

delete - Delete or keep
       Either Y, J (Yes) or N (No). If yes, the entry will be deleted
       when it's time has passed. No keeps it. Usually you would set
       'Y' for one-timers and 'N' for annual events.

lead - Advance time in days for activating display
     This one or two digit field gives the number of days you want to
     be informed in advance of your appointment. When this time span is
     reached, the appointment will be displayed until it passes by.
     '0' means only display on the given date.



Command Line Options
********************

The command line options override the default settings and
the configuration file.


--help, -h, -?
	Prints a small help screen
--version, -V
        Program version
--config <file>, -c <file>
	 Use <file> as configuration file
	 If not set, the default is ~/.csterminrc

Command line options are case insensitive.

For more information and the options concerning the behavior
of cstermin, see the following section "Configuration".



Configuration
*************

cstermin uses three ways to determine the value of certain
options. First there are defaults, then it reads the configuration
file and last of all the command line options are considered.

Settings in the Configuration File
----------------------------------

e.g.: "Options: Output-Console yes"

The structure is:
reserved_word option_name value

reserved_word:
The reserved word is always "Options:" (technically the
space after it also belongs to the reserved word).

option_name:
Just the name, and nothing more. The option name is case sensitive.

value:
All options explained here are binary options. This means if there
is no value given, their meaning is "set".
If you append "0", "false" or "no", then it means unset.
All other words again mean "set".
Summary: "0", "false", "no": unset
	    everything else: set
The value is case insensitive.

Command Line Options
--------------------

Besides the command line options mentioned in the section "Command
Line Options", there are also toggle options.
Most of the options have one long form and one short form. The long
form, which is preceded by two hyphen, can be shortened until
uniqueness.

If the option is issued, it means "set". The long form of options can be
negated by prepending "no" or "no-", then the option means "unset".
For example "--debug" means enable debug, but "--no-debug" means
disable debug.

The options are case insensitive.

Known Options
-------------

The following options are used in cstermin:

Output-Console: Print the appointments to standard output
   Output-Gtk:  Show the appointments with the help of a Gtk window
     Force-Run: Run upon every call, not only once a day
        Modify: Allow modification of the config file by cstermin
         Debug: Print debug messages

Representation of the options
-----------------------------

Meaning of the columns
        Name - Name of the option
     Default - Default Value
 Config File - option_name in the config file
Command Line - Name of the command line option


Name	       |Default|Config File   |Command Line
---------------+-------+--------------+---------------------------
Output-Console |set    |Output-Console|--output-console, --console
   Output-Gtk  |unset  |Output-Gtk    |--output-gtk, --gtk
     Force-Run |unset  |Force-Run     |--force-run, --force, --run
        Modify |set    |Modify        |--modify, -m
        Debug: |unset  |Debug         |--debug, -d


Internal used Options in the Configuration File
-----------------------------------------------

This options are modified by cstermin itself.

Last-Run: The date cstermin was last invoked
	  format is DD.MM.YYYY


Hidden Options inside cstermin.pl
---------------------------------

At the beginning of the cstermin executable file you find a marked
section, where you can change various options which are not
controlled by the command line.

These settings include:
- Text prefix for passed and today's appointments
- Hightlighting style for passed and today's appointments
- Output date format



Graphical Output
****************

If enabled, the appointments are displayed in a graphical window.

Not much to say about it, as there are only two buttons.
The "OK" Button closes the window and continues the program run.
The "Later" Button closes the window, but does not modifies
the configuration file. The apparent effect is that all appointments
will be displayed again this day on the following run, even when
cstermin is instructed not to do so.



Exit Codes
**********

No Error

0: Okay

Critical errors (i.e. program terminates at once)

2: Error parsing the command line

Non-Critical errors (i.e. program continues)

100: Error in config file
